  <h2 align="center">Why Reactor?</h2>
  <p>Minecraft contains poorly written code, full of memory leaks and bad practices (not even Paper and other forks can save it). Ok, so what about Minestom? It's not a bad alternative, but it's also quite poorly programmed, and you have to code everything yourself with little to no foundation.
  </p>

  <p>
  These are the main reasons for creating Reactor—a relatively well-programmed server with high performance and a solid foundation for creating plugins (you don’t have to start everything from scratch like in Minestom).
